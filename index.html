<h2>What is Old Money</h2>
    <p>Old Money is an aesthetic based on a rich vintage style. Old Money refers to people who inherited their wealth instead of working for it. In the United States, Old Money is associated with the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) culture, and in Europe, Old Money is associated with titles of nobility.</p>

<h2>Old Money History</h2>
<p>Old Money is most prominent in countries were there was no aristocracy but instead an elite social class held a status nearly equal to an aristocracy.

    In the United States, the oldest Old Money families are the ones which can trace their ancestry back to the passengers on the Mayflower. Other families are considered Old Money when they can trace their ancestry back to the founders of a prestigious town such as New York City, for example the fictional van der Woodsens in Gossip Girl, who are descendants of Dutch settlers in New York.
    
    The Social Register, a list of the wealthiest and most influential American families was first published in 1887. Some major cities have their own versions of the Social Register. In recent times, it has become less of an indicator of Old Money pedigree.
    
    In the 1930s, Old Money families traced their wealth back to at least the American Revolution. Those who had gained wealth around the time of the American Civil War and during the Gilded Age, were not yet considered Old Money. Today, families whose wealth dates back only to the Gilded Age are considered Old Money.</p>
